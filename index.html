    <p>
      I'm Tom, a full stack developer from Rhode Island. I am fascinated with
      technology and the challenge of learning new and interesting things. I'm
      married to my beautiful wife Ashley, and father of an awesome little guy
      who is definitely much cooler than I am!
    </p>
    <p>
      By day I design, develop, and implement software solutions for meat and
      seafood distributors, but at night I spend my time exploring all things
      web development. I've been developing software for over 5 years, but
      recently have found that my true passion lies in the World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's alot of exciting and quickly changing tech to learn out there, so
      I hope this website can be used to help facilitate my journey and as a
      tool to help convey my passion to others and perhaps share some neat stuff
      along the way!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always excited for new opportunities and value constructive feedback.
      If there is anything you want to share with me, feel free to drop a line!
